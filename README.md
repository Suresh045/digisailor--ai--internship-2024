Here's a sample README for your Object Detection project on GitHub:

Object Detection System
This project implements an Object Detection model that identifies and classifies objects in real-time using a live camera feed. The system is designed to recognize everyday objects like pens, mobiles, and more, leveraging machine learning techniques.

Features
Real-Time Detection: Detects objects in real-time using a live camera feed.
Custom Object Identification: Recognizes everyday objects such as pens, mobiles, etc.
Machine Learning: Utilizes pre-trained models for accurate object detection.
Scalability: Easily extendable to detect more objects by updating the dataset.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras (for the model)
Dataset: Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset (customizable for everyday objects)
Hardware: Laptop Camera (or any connected webcam)
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-detection-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd object-detection-system
Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNet, YOLO). You can download or train your own model and save it in the appropriate folder.

Usage
Run the object detection script:


python object_detection.py
The live camera feed will open, and objects within the frame will be detected and labeled with their names.

Training Your Own Model
To train a custom object detection model:

Update the dataset with images of the objects you want to detect.

Modify the training script to train on the new dataset.

Run the training:

python train_model.py
Once trained, the new model can be used in the detection script.

Example Output
Detected Object: Pen
Accuracy: 95%
